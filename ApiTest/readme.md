## Features
- User creation with validation
- Status management (verified/unverified)
- Sending reminder emails to unverified users

## Technologies Used
- ASP.NET Core
- Entity Framework Core with SQLite
- SMTP for email notifications

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/user-management-api.git
cd user-management-api
```

### 2. Install Dependencies:
```bash
dotnet restore
```

### 3. Set Up Configuration:
- Add your SMTP configuration to `appsettings.json`.
- Create a SQLite database by running migrations:
```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

### 4. Run the Application:
```bash
dotnet run
```

## API Endpoints
- `POST /users`: Create a new user
- `GET /users`: Retrieve all users
- `POST /send_reminder`: Send reminder emails to unverified users

## Handling 1000x Users

When scaling the application to handle 1000x users, several design considerations need to be addressed:

1. **Database Optimization**: 
   - Move from SQLite to a more robust database like PostgreSQL or Microsoft SQL Server to handle increased read/write operations.
   - Implement database indexing for faster queries, especially on frequently accessed columns.

2. **Caching**: 
   - Introduce caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis or in-memory caching) to reduce the load on the database and improve response times for frequently requested data.

3. **Load Balancing**:
   - Use a load balancer to distribute incoming requests across multiple instances of the application, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.

4. **Email Queueing**:
   - Implement an email queue (e.g., using RabbitMQ or Azure Queue Storage) to manage sending reminder emails asynchronously, preventing the application from slowing down during peak times.

5. **Horizontal Scaling**:
   - Containerize the application (e.g., using Docker) to facilitate horizontal scaling across multiple servers.

6. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Integrate monitoring solutions (like Prometheus and Grafana) to track performance metrics and system health, enabling proactive maintenance.
